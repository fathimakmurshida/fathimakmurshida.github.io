                <h1>About Block chain</h1>
                <p>With the rise of Bitcoin, crypto-currencies have already grabbed attention by
                    researchers and economists around the world. With more than a hundreds of
                    cryptocoins present, the area of crypto-currency is of high importance. One of
                    the newest cryptocurrency is iota; which is a cryptocurrency designed for the
                    future of Internet of Things.
                    Iota is a distributed, decentralized open-source ledger focused on pro-
                    viding secure payments and communications between machines on the Internet
                    of Things. iota uses BlockDAG, also called as The Tangle, which is an exten-
                    sion to the Blockchain technology used by Bitcoin by using a directed acyclic
                    graph instead of a linked list. Blockchain technology have several drawbacks
                    and iota with its Tangle solves the problem of implementing a cost-free fully
                    decentralized scalable consensus system which is resistant to a Quantum at-
                    tack. iota also have defence mechanism against some possible attack vectors
                    that are suggested.
                    A blockchain,[1][2][3] originally block chain,[4][5] is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography.[1][6] Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block,[6] a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a merkle tree root hash).

                    By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way".[7] For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. Decentralized consensus has therefore been claimed with a blockchain.[8]

                    Blockchain was invented by a person using the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin.[1] The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is unknown. The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications,

            <p>A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved record cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.[1][18] This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.[19] A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests.[20] Such a design facilitates robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double spending. A blockchain has been described as a value-exchange protocol.[21] A blockchain can maintain title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.</p>
